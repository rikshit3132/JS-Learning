# Rendering Engine (Browser Engine)
A Rendering Engine is responsible for:
-> Displaying content on the screen
 Examples:-
-> Blink → Chrome, Edge
-> WebKit → Safari
-> Gecko → Firefox
# What Rendering Engine does
-> Parses HTML
-> Parses CSS
-> Builds DOM Tree
-> Builds CSSOM
-> Creates Render Tree
-> Layout (position & size)
-> Paint pixels on screen

<h1>Hello</h1>
Rendering engine:
Converts HTML → pixels on screen


# Rendering Engine does NOT do

-> Does not execute JS
-> Does not manage call stack
-> Does not handle promises

Example:-

<button id="btn">Click</button>
<script>
  document.getElementById("btn").style.color = "red";
</script>

Flow:
1) Rendering engine
-> Parses HTML
-> Creates DOM

2) JS engine
-> Executes JS
-> Calls document.getElementById()

3) Rendering engine
-> Updates DOM
-> Re-layout
-> Re-paint screen

-> They coordinate, but have different responsibilities.

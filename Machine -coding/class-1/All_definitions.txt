# what is browser ?
1) A browser (web browser) is a software application
that lets you access, 
view, and interact with websites on the internet.

2) A browser is the app that 
opens websites and shows web pages.

# what browser do ?
-> Takes a website address (URL) like https://google.com
-> Sends a request to a web server
-> Receives HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
-> Renders (draws) the page on your screen
-> Runs JavaScript code and handles user
 actions (clicks, input, etc.)

 # what browser provides us as a developer ?
 1) JavaScript Engine
Executes your JavaScript code.
Examples:
V8 → Chrome, Edge
SpiderMonkey → Firefox
JavaScriptCore → Safari
console.log("JS runs because of browser engine");
Note:- Without a browser, JS won’t run on the web.

2) Web Api's
-> These are not part of JavaScript, 
they are provided by the browser.
Common Web APIs:

-> DOM API → document.getElementById
-> Timers → setTimeout, setInterval
-> Fetch API → fetch()
-> Storage → localStorage, sessionStorage
-> Geolocation
-> Clipboard
-> History API
-> Canvas API

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Provided by browser");
}, 1000);

3) DOM (Document Object Model)

-> Browser converts HTML into a 
tree structure you can manipulate.
-> document.querySelector("h1").style.color = "red";

4) CSS Rendering Engine

-> Browser:
-> Parses CSS
-> Calculates layout
-> Paints pixels on the screen
-> Without this, UI won’t appear.
-> Google Chrome uses the Blink rendering engine

5) Event System
Handles user interaction:

-> Click
-> Scroll
-> Keypress
-> Mouse move
-> Touch

button.addEventListener("click", () => {
  alert("Clicked!");
});

6) Networking Capabilities
Browser handles:
-> HTTP/HTTPS requests
-> CORS
-> Cookies
-> Headers

fetch("/api/users")
  .then(res => res.json());

7) Storage & Persistence

-> Browser provides client-side storage:

# Storage	                       # Use

-> localStorage	                    Permanent
-> sessionStorage	                Tab-based
-> cookies	                        Small data
-> IndexedDB	                  Large structured data

8) Security Sandbox 
Browser protects users by:
-> Blocking direct file system access
-> Enforcing Same-Origin Policy
-> Preventing malicious scripts
Note:- This is why JS cannot access your
     PC files directly.

9) Developer Tools (DevTools) 

Extremely powerful tools:
-> Console
-> Network tab
-> Performance profiling
-> Memory leak detection
-> React DevTools

-> A browser provides a JavaScript runtime, 
Web APIs, DOM, rendering engine, networking, 
storage, security sandbox, and 
developer tools to build and run web applications.
